 * The same surface as scripts/ios/wda-client.mjs, over adb — so one e2e test drives both platforms.
 *
 * Android needs no server and no signing: adb is already the channel. `uiautomator dump` gives the
 * accessibility tree, `input tap/swipe/text` are the hands, `exec-out screencap` the eyes. The tree arrives as
 * XML with `bounds="[x1,y1][x2,y2]"`, so it is normalised here into the SAME node shape WDA returns
 * ({ label, name, value, rect, children }) — which is what lets findByLabel, waitFor and a test written once
 * work unchanged on either device.
 *
 * Coordinates are physical pixels on Android and logical points on iOS. Nothing here needs to care, because
 * every gesture goes through an element's own centre rather than a hardcoded coordinate.
