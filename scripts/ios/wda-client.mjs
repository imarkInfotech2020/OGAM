/**
 * A minimal WebDriverAgent client — eyes and hands on a real iPhone, over plain HTTP.
 *
 * WDA is Apple's XCUITest runner exposed as a REST server. Once it is up (see launch-wda.mjs) it serves over
 * the device's own address, so no tunnel and no Appium in the middle: observe with /screenshot and /source,
 * act with the W3C /actions endpoint.
 *
 * Callers locate a target by MEANING - its accessibility label - and tap its true on-screen centre, which is
 * why the app's testIDs matter more than pixel coordinates. A layout change moves the centre; it does not
 * break the test.
 *
 * Deliberately small and dependency-free. It is not a test framework - node:test and node:assert are the
 * runner and the assertions - but it does carry the one thing a black-box driver cannot do without:
 * waitFor(), so a test waits for the screen it expects instead of sleeping for a guessed interval.
 *
 * scripts/android/adb-client.mjs implements the same surface over adb, so one test drives both platforms.
