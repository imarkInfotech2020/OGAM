 * "Model loaded: Qwythos 9B (3.1s)" is a fact about the machine that loaded it. Synced verbatim it
 * becomes a false statement everywhere else: a phone claiming it loaded a model it never loaded,
 * at a speed it never reached. Nothing is deleted - the notice still syncs, and the device that
 * wrote it still shows it - it is simply not repeated where it is not true.
 *
 * A device's own notices carry provenance too, once the record round-trips through sync, so the
 * presence of provenance is not the test. The origin has to be compared with this device.
 *
 * With no local device id (free builds, or before the mesh has named this device) nothing is
 * hidden: without an identity there is no way to tell whose notice it is, and showing a true
 * notice is a smaller error than hiding one.
