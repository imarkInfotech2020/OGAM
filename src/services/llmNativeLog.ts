/**
 * llama.cpp native-log passthrough.
 *
 * rnllama collapses every load failure to a generic "Failed to load model" — the
 * REAL reason (e.g. "error loading model: missing tensor blk.0.altup_proj", or
 * "unknown model architecture", or "tensor 'x' has wrong size") is written by
 * llama.cpp to its own log and otherwise lost. This enables that log ONCE, streams
 * it to our logger under [LLM-NATIVE], and keeps a small ring buffer so a load
 * failure can attach the actual reason to the error it throws. Model-load failures
 * are then never opaque again.

 * file writes on the JS thread, in the middle of the load they describe. On device that starved the
 * load itself - the app looked frozen (112% CPU, no ANR) and the text model then failed with
 * "loading timed out after 120s".
 *
 * They are still kept in the ring buffer, which is the point of this passthrough: a load failure can
 * attach the real reason. The ring is memory and costs nothing; the file is what hurt.
