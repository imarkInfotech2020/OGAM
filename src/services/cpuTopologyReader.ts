 * The I/O half of "which cores are worth running inference on": read the kernel's per-core topology
 * from sysfs and hand the numbers to the pure rule. Separate from the rule so the rule can be tested
 * on real device topologies with no filesystem, and separate from hardwareService so the service
 * stays about what the device IS rather than how to read it.
 *
 * `cpu_capacity` is the scheduler's 0-1024 rating and exists on any DynamIQ/EAS kernel — effectively
 * every modern Android phone. `cpuinfo_max_freq` is the same clustering signal on older kernels, so
 * it is the fallback. A core whose files cannot be read is skipped rather than guessed at.
