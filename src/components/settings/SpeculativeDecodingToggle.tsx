 * tokens are exactly the tokens the model would have produced anyway.
 *
 * Only models shipped with MTP draft layers can do it. The engine silently never drafts on the
 * rest, so this is a preference rather than a promise, and the copy says so instead of claiming a
 * speed-up every model will deliver.
