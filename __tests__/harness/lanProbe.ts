/**
 * lanProbe — a behavior-faithful fake of the LAN at the `fetch` boundary.
 *
 * The scan asks 254 addresses on three ports whether an LLM server answers. That question is
 * settled by the network, which is outside our system, so this stands in for it. Everything above
 * it runs REAL: the subnet maths, the worker pool, the provider table, the aggregation, the
 * manager that adds the server, the store, and the screen.
 *
 * Faithful to how a subnet actually replies:
 *  - A host that is listening answers 200 with its model list.
 *  - Every other address REFUSES, the way a live host with a closed port does. Nothing here
 *    resolves out of a hat: the scan finds a server only if the real code asks the right address,
 *    on the right port, at the right path.
 *  - An aborted request rejects, so the caller's own deadline still governs.
