/**
 * A device leaving the mesh takes its rules with it - both directions, together.
 *
 * Per-device rules outliving the device is the quiet failure: ids get reused, and a sharing or receive rule kept
 * past eviction silently applies to whatever device later claims that id. The user re-pairs a phone, everything
 * looks normal, and it is either receiving something they turned off or refusing something they never refused -
 * with nothing on any screen to explain it.
 *
 * Both real services run here (ambientShareService for what leaves, receivePreferences for what lands), with
 * persistence over the AsyncStorage boundary the repo already fakes. The failure path is driven by making that
 * boundary reject, which is how it actually fails on a device - a full disk, a revoked container - rather than
 * by standing in for one of our own services and asserting it was called.
