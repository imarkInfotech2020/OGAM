/**
 * The phone's record of which devices it trusts, and the secrets that prove it.
 *
 * This is the most consequential store in the app: a secret lost means the user types a pairing code again, a
 * secret kept when it should not be means a revoked device can still be talked to, and a trust decision written
 * halfway means a device that is neither paired nor unpaired.
 *
 * So pairing is two-phase - staged, then committed - and the one rule that makes it safe is that a commit must
 * match what was staged. Everything else here is about the difference between "this peer did not answer" and
 * "trust is gone", which look identical on the wire and must not be treated the same.
 *
 * The keychain is stood in for; the trust document, its parser and the revocation state machine are real.
