/**
 * Sharing a file to another of the user's devices without being asked every time.
 *
 * The user says, once, "screenshots go to my Mac" - and from then on a screenshot leaves this phone with
 * nothing to tap. That is a standing consent, and standing consent is exactly the thing that has to be
 * conservative: the wrong answer here sends a file the user did not mean to send, to a device they were
 * not thinking about, with no moment at which they could have stopped it.
 *
 * So the decisions this holds are all about DOUBT:
 *  - Told to ask: nothing leaves until a person taps, and cancelling means it never goes.
 *  - Not told anything: nothing leaves, and the file does not sit in a queue implying it will.
 *  - The far device is not there: either it waits or it is dropped, and the user chose which.
 *  - Consent withdrawn: whatever was mid-flight stops mattering, including its outcome.
 *
 * The service runs for real against real storage. What stands in is Sync itself - the peers it can see and
 * the transfers it schedules - because that is the boundary this service is written against.

   * A peer that has lost a file asks the devices that might still hold it. Answering is how a mesh
   * heals itself, but "may I send you these bytes again" is a consent question, not a plumbing one -
   * and this phone keeps its answer in two fields (an approval state and a transfer state) where the
   * Mac keeps one. Reading those two fields wrongly has both failure modes:
   *
   *  - too strict, and the phone refuses to heal a file it has already sent. The Mac healed it and the
   *    phone did not, on the same mesh, for the same file - which is the bug this rule was written for.
   *  - too loose, and a peer gets bytes the user never agreed to send by claiming to have lost them.
   *
   * The service runs for real, and every state below is arrived at the way the app arrives at it.
