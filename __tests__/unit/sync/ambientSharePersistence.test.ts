/**
 * What this phone remembers about ambient sharing across launches.
 *
 * Three things live here: the rules the user set, the files still waiting to go, and the approval decisions
 * they already gave. Losing any of them has a visible cost - a rule lost means files start moving that the user
 * turned off, a queue lost means a screenshot taken on a plane never arrives, and an approval lost means being
 * asked twice about the same file.
 *
 * So this is a parser as much as a store: everything read back is untrusted (it survives upgrades and can be
 * restored from a backup), and the safe answer to an unreadable rule is to fall back to the preferences the user
 * already expressed rather than to invent a permissive default.
