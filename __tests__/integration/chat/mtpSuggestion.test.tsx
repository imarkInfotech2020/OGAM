/**
 * UI integration — the in-chat offer to turn on MTP speculative decoding.
 *
 * Real card + real store + real detection service + real rule. Only llama.rn's GGUF header read is
 * faked, at the native line, and it serves metadata read off REAL model files: the negative case is
 * the actual key set dumped from the Qwen3.5-0.8B Q4_K_M on the test device, so "no card" is a
 * verdict about a real model rather than an empty object standing in for one.
 *
 * The product rule this pins: the offer appears only for a model that can actually use MTP, says it
 * will reload before you tap, and both enables the setting AND performs the reload when you do.
 * Advertising a speed-up a model cannot deliver is worse than staying quiet.
