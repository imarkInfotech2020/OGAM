/**
 * What the user can DO while an image is being generated - the window a mocked generator has no way to open.
 *
 * Diffusion takes many seconds on a device. That whole time the user is sitting in front of a progress card with a
 * STOP control, and three things have to hold:
 *
 *  - STOP actually reaches the native generator and the card goes away. A stop that only flips a JS flag leaves the
 *    NPU burning battery on an image nobody will ever see, and on a phone that is heat and a dead battery.
 *  - the progress the native side reports is the progress shown. A card reading "Generating image (1/20)" for
 *    twenty seconds is indistinguishable from a hang, and the user force-quits an app that was working.
 *  - a second send while it runs does not start a second diffusion. Two loaded diffusion pipelines is the
 *    OOM-kill case on any phone this app targets.
 *
 * Everything below is the real ChatScreen, the real imageGenerationService and the real localDreamGenerator, with
 * only the native diffusion module faked. The generation is HELD OPEN at the native call (the harness's
 * holdNextGeneration), which is what makes the in-flight window addressable at all.
 *
 * REPLACES three cases from imageGenerationFlow.test.ts, which stood in for localDreamGenerator itself - the very
 * thing whose in-flight behaviour was under test. With the generator mocked, "cancel" asserted that our service
 * called a jest.fn, and native could not have kept running afterwards even if the real code never told it to stop.
