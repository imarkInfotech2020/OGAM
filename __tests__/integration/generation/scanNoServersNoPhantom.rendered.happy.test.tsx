/**
 * T047 / DEV-B8 (GREEN guard) — scanning the LAN with no server present reports that nothing answered AND
 * leaves the server list empty: what the scan SAYS and what the list SHOWS must AGREE (no phantom server).
 *
 * Device (B8): the scan toast said "no servers found" while a server was simultaneously added to the list —
 * a state desync. The current code returns early on `discovered.length === 0` (RemoteServersScreen.tsx:74),
 * so this guards that fix from regressing: empty discovery → the report shown, zero rows added.
 *
 * The report is now an inline line rather than a dialog, and it names the ports that were tried, so a user
 * left with "nothing found" has something to act on. The guard is unchanged: the report and the list agree.
 *
 * Real gestures: mount the real RemoteServersScreen with the real remoteServerStore, tap "Scan network".
 * The discovery boundary is faked at its device leaves (react-native-device-info isEmulator + the global
 * fetch LAN probe), never at our networkDiscovery service — so the REAL scan/aggregation logic runs.
 * isEmulator()=true is the device-faithful "no scan possible" leaf → discoverLANServers returns []. Falsify:
 * a reachable server on the subnet (probe → 200) → a server row IS added and the empty state disappears.
