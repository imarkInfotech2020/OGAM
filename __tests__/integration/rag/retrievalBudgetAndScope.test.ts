/**
 * What retrieval is allowed to put in the prompt: how much, and whose.
 *
 * Two things decide whether a project chat works at all, and neither is about finding text:
 *
 *  - THE BUDGET. Retrieved chunks are prepended to the user's question, so a retrieval that ignores the
 *    context window pushes the question itself out of the window. The user watches the model answer a
 *    different question, or answer nothing, with no error anywhere.
 *  - THE SCOPE. A project's knowledge base must return that project's documents and no others. A leak here
 *    means one client's contract quoted into another client's chat - the worst failure this app can have,
 *    and completely silent.
 *
 * Everything runs for real over a REAL in-memory SQLite (harness/sqliteFake), so the documents are genuinely
 * indexed, chunked, embedded and selected back with the actual SQL - including the WHERE that scopes a search
 * to one project. Only two boundaries are stood in for: native document extraction, and the embedding model
 * (deterministic keyword vectors, so cosine ranking is real rather than canned).
 *
 * REPLACES the budget + project-scope + tool-error cases from `ragFlow.test.ts`, which are deleted. That file
 * mocked the DATABASE by matching SQL strings - `if (sql.includes('rag_chunks')) return { rows: [...] }` - and
 * then wrote `ragDatabase.ready = true` and `ragDatabase.db = mockDb` onto private fields. Retrieval "found"
 * whatever the matcher was told to hand back, so as batch9-kb-roundtrip's header already recorded, deleting
 * insertDocument or insertChunks from the source would not have failed a single one of those tests.
