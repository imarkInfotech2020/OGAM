/**
 * UI integration (heavy entry point) — resending a turn whose image generation was CANCELLED.
 *
 * Device evidence (Android 2026-08-09 17:00, reproduced on iOS): "draw a dog running" was generating,
 * the user pressed the X on the progress card, then resent the same message — and got PROSE. The log
 * shows the modality flipping between the two resends of the same message:
 *
 *   16:59:46 [RESEND-SM] retry user msg idx=11 ... recordedKind=image   → dispatch → IMAGE pipeline
 *   17:00:00 [IMG-SM]    phase generating → idle                        (the X)
 *   17:00:02 [RESEND-SM] retry user msg idx=11 ... recordedKind=text    → dispatch → TEXT generation
 *
 * The turn's kind was DERIVED from the replies that survived, and a cancelled image turn keeps only its
 * "Enhanced prompt" reply and never gets its image — so it read back as a text turn. From the user's
 * view: a turn they asked to be drawn stays a drawing turn, and resending it draws again. Cancelling is
 * not a change of mind about the modality.
 *
 * Prompt enhancement is ON deliberately: that reply is what the derivation tripped over, so with it off
 * the turn has no reply at all and the bug does not exist. This is the exact condition the device hit.
 *
 * Real ChatScreen + real dispatch/resend seam + real imageGenerationService; only llama and diffusion
 * natives are faked. The generation is PARKED in native so the X is pressed while it is genuinely
 * in flight, as on the device.
