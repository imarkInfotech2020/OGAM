/**
 * HAPPY-PATH (UI integration, HEAVY entry point) — the "Support Open-Source AI" share sheet dismisses
 * after the user shares on X and does NOT re-nag on later generations.
 *
 * Row T096 (Area 14): "Trigger the support-share sheet → tap Share on X → return to app → the sheet is
 * dismissed (doesn't re-nag)". Device finding (docs/DEVICE_TEST_FINDINGS.md): "Support-sheet dismissal —
 * the 'support open source AI' share sheet dismisses correctly after returning from X (doesn't re-nag)."
 *
 * Heavy entry point: the REAL ChatScreen is mounted; the REAL generationService drives the REAL trigger
 * (checkSharePrompt increments the real textGenerationCount and, via shouldShowSharePrompt, emits the
 * prompt after 2 text generations, then again every 10th). The REAL SharePromptSheet renders inside
 * ChatScreen. We arrive at the sheet by SENDING real messages (never store.setState / emitSharePrompt),
 * tap the REAL "Share on X" button, and assert on the RENDERED UI:
 *   1. after the share, the sheet is gone, AND
 *   2. after driving generations up to the every-10th re-trigger count, the sheet does NOT re-appear.
 *
 * The ONLY device boundary faked is Linking.openURL (the leaf that hands the X compose intent to the OS —
 * "tap Share on X"), plus the engine leaf via chatHarness. The re-nag guard under test is the REAL
 * `hasEngagedSharePrompt` persistence: handleEngage sets it, and the real checkSharePrompt honors it.
