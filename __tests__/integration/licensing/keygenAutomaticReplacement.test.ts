/**
 * Activating a key on a licence that is already full.
 *
 * A user with five devices buying a sixth must not be told to go and free a seat by hand - the oldest is
 * retired for them. "Oldest" means least recently active, so the phone they used this morning is never the
 * one dropped.
 *
 * This test used to model the flow the app had when it was written: list the machines, DELETE the least
 * recent, POST the new one, all against a hand-written fetch matcher. Two things had moved since. The choice
 * now belongs to PersonalMeshRegistrationCoordinator - and, the actual reason it was failing,
 * activateProByKey delegates to a REGISTERED entitlement provider whose default answers
 * { ok: false, reason: 'registration_failed' } to everything. Nothing had registered one, so the test never
 * reached Keygen and its "registration failed" was the fallback talking rather than a licence being refused.
 *
 * It now registers the real provider the way loadProFeatures does, and stands Keygen up as a fake at the HTTP
 * boundary: real licences and machines, the seat cap enforced, Keygen's own JSON:API shapes. Everything above
 * that is the app - the client, the credential store, the mesh registry, the coordinator.
