/**
 * UI (rendered) — where the load spinner sits in the model sheet.
 *
 * Two device bugs shaped this, in order, and the rule has to satisfy both at once:
 *
 *   2026-07-14: model A was loaded, the user tapped B, and the spinner appeared on A. Keying it off
 *   "is this row the active model" put it on the row that was NOT being loaded.
 *
 *   2026-07-31: keying it off the row the user TAPPED span for ever. Tapping a row deliberately does
 *   not start a load - it only marks a model, and the load is deferred to the first message - so the
 *   parent's isLoading never turned true and the row went on claiming to load something nothing was
 *   loading.
 *
 * So the spinner is derived from the model service: it appears only while something is actually being
 * loaded, and it appears on the model being loaded. This suite drives the real ModelSelectorModal over
 * the real store, with only the native boundary faked.
