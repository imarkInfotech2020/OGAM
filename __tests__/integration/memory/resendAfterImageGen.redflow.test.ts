/**
 * Integration — M11: resending a text turn after image-gen reloads the text model WITHOUT OOM.
 *
 * After image generation the image model is dirty-resident. Resending a text turn reloads the CLEAN
 * text model. With ample live RAM under balanced, the clean (mmap GGUF) text weights
 * page in around the dirty image without evicting it (5235 + 2369 = 7604 < the
 * ~8602 budget). Low live RAM instead refuses the load; see the rendered Android
 * low-memory image guard. Runs the real manager over the native RAM-sensor boundary.
