/**
 * The notifications screen's filter: what the user sees when they narrow it down.
 *
 * This screen is where three unrelated things pile up - files waiting for the user's approval, completed
 * transfers, and the results of ones already decided. The filter exists because that pile is unreadable, so the
 * filter has to actually narrow: choosing Approvals and still seeing transfers makes it useless, and choosing
 * Approvals and seeing NOTHING when approvals exist hides the one thing on this screen that is waiting on a
 * person.
 *
 * The empty copy matters just as much. "No files are waiting for approval" is the answer to a question the user
 * asked; a blank area is not, and reads as a screen that failed to load. The singular/plural line ("1 file is"
 * versus "2 files are") is the kind of thing nobody notices until it says "1 files are".
 *
 * Real screen, real store, real projections. Faked: the icon font, navigation, and the native TCP and mDNS
 * modules the sync services build emitters over at import.
